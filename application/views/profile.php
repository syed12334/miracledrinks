					  <p>Miracle Drinks is the result of over 40 years of research done by Dr. S.M. Raju IAS
                       (Retd.). Dr. Raju initially developed these medicines to help relieve himself of 
                       Rheumatoid Arthritis; he suffered from that painful disease for many years until he 
                       was able to formulate a series of concoctions that helped alleviate his pain and 
                       suffering. </p>
                       
                       <p>He went further into his research when his father suffered from Acute Renal 
                       Failure. He developed a series of concoctions and diets which helped in the 
                       rejuvenation of his father’s kidneys. </p>
                       
						<p>Tragedy struck again when his son suffered from Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 
                        (Blood Cancer). Although his son did benefit greatly from his herbal 
                        concoctions, this road to recovery is credited for being one of the first 
                        approaches of integrated medicine; i.e. Allopathic medication along with 
                        an Ayurvedic set of concoctions – taken together. </p>
